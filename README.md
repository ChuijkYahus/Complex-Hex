# Complex Hex

... is an addon for Hexcasting with whatever I feel like adding lol.

## features
complex numbers - implemented, probably works fine lmao \
quaternions - implemented, probably works fine lmao \
Bubbles - implemented, seems to work fine \

## working on it
patterns to manipulate block/item/text display entities - working on it :) \

## Ideas
maybe some way to crystallise media into pure crystals? \
patterns to allow wisps to wait for an interactionEntity to do something? \
double casting item that would have two different hexes, which would be cast on subsequent uses but preserve ravenmind and/or stack in the middle? \
maybe even a multi-casting item which could have an arbitrary amount of hexes? \
